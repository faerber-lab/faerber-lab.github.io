Hi, welcome to Faerber Lab!

I'm Michael Färber, and since April 2024, I’ve been a W3 Full Professor and the head of the research group "Scalable Software Architectures for Data Analytics" at the AI Center ScaDS.AI at the Technical University (TU) Dresden. I was appointed to this role at the age of 36. Before that, from 2020 to 2024, I served as a Deputy Full Professor (“W3-Vertretungsprofessor”) for Web Science at the Institute AIFB of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT, Germany). During that time, I led a team of 7 PhD students, 1 junior research group leader, and 1 postdoc.

My research focuses on AI, particularly at the intersection of natural language processing, machine learning, and knowledge representation. I’m also interested in areas like explainable AI and machine learning on graph data.
