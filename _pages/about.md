Welcome! I’m Michael Färber, and since April 2024, I have been serving as a W3 Full Professor and leading the _Scalable Software Architectures for Data Analytics_ research group at the AI Center ScaDS.AI at TU Dresden, Germany.

Our group conducts research at the intersection of AI, natural language processing, machine learning, and knowledge representation. We are also focused on advancing explainable AI and applying machine learning to graph data. If you are interested in these areas, please feel free to contact us—we would be happy to connect!
