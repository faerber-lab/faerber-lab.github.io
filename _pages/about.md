Welcome! Iâ€™m **Michael FÃ¤rber**, I lead the _Scalable Software Architectures for Data Analytics_ research group at ScaDS.AI/TU Dresden, Germany. Our work lies at the intersection of **AI, natural language processing, machine learning**, and **knowledge representation**, extending into **explainable AI** and **graph-based machine learning**. If these topics interest you, feel free to reach out at michael.faerber@tu-dresden.de.

We're located at ScaDS.AI Office at _Strehlener Str. 12-14, Dresden_ (<a href='https://maps.app.goo.gl/uFTw5hc9hp35bbWf6'>GMaps</a>). Explore our latest <a href='https://faerber-lab.github.io/vacancies/'>vacancies and open thesis supervision</a> to join our group.
