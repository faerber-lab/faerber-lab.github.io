Welcome to Faerber Lab! I’m Michael Färber, and since April 2024, I’ve been serving as a W3 Full Professor and leading the "Scalable Software Architectures for Data Analytics" research group at the AI Center ScaDS.AI at the Technical University (TU) Dresden.

Our group is engaged in research at the intersection of AI, natural language processing, machine learning, and knowledge representation. We also focus on advancing explainable AI and applying machine learning to graph data. If you’re interested in these areas, feel free to contact us—we’d be happy to connect!
