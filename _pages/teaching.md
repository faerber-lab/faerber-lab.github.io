### SecretLLM: Behind the Secrets of Large Language Models

**Period**: Winter 2024/2025

This course offers a **practical and in-depth exploration** of large language models (LLMs), which are at the core of modern natural language processing (NLP) systems. Students will gain hands-on experience alongside theoretical insights into LLM architecture, training methodologies, capabilities, and ethical considerations.

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. **Understand** the architecture and key components of large language models.
2. **Analyze** training processes, including data collection, model optimization, and fine-tuning.
3. **Evaluate** the performance and limitations of LLMs across various NLP tasks.
4. **Apply** LLMs to real-world applications, such as text generation, summarization, and translation.
5. **Discuss** the ethical considerations and societal impacts of deploying LLMs.

#### **Prerequisites**
- Prior knowledge of **Introduction to Machine Learning** or an equivalent course.
- A **basic understanding of neural networks**.
- **Programming experience in Python**.

This course is offered together with Simon Razniewski
